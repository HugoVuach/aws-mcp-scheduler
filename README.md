# Modified Critical Path Task Scheduler

This project implements the **Modified Critical Path (MCP)** algorithm for **task scheduling under constraints** (dependencies, memory, heterogeneous resources).  
Developed as part of a CentraleSupélec project in collaboration with **Aneo** (consulting in HPC, Cloud, AI/ML).

## Features
- Implementation of the MCP scheduling algorithm based on critical path theory  
- Dynamic allocation of heterogeneous resources (memory constraints, failures, elasticity)  
- Consideration of inter-processor communication costs  
- Scalable to graphs with up to **100,000 nodes**  
- Deployment on **AWS Cloud** using S3 and Lambda for high-performance simulations  

## Results
- Efficient scheduling close to the theoretical critical path  
- Robust handling of failures and dynamic resource availability  
- Successful scaling to large graphs with cloud deployment
